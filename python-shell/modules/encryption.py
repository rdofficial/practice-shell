encryption.py - Python Shell

A module created for supplying the required functions to the shell application. The functions and classes defined in this module ease many tasks at the shell application, in general way they are used in executing the task assigned by the user via the commands. This module contains functions and classes related to directory handling and other such stuff.

class StringEncrypter:
	""" This class serves the features / functionality of encryption as well as decryption of the strings. The encryption / decryption is carried out with a password (encryption key). The class uses its own seperate ways of encryption. Thus if any text / plain string is encrypted using this class (tool), then it can be only decrypted using the decrypt() method of this class.

	This class takes parameter inputs from the user in two ways :
	1. From parsing arguments

		In this mode, the arguments parsed at the shell after the user enters a command are passed to this class object. The syntax is below.

		StringEncrypter(arguments = <parsed arguments list>)

		--password			Used to specify the password for encryption / decryption
		--task              Used to specify the task whether encryption / decryption

		The text / string for encryption is then asked to the user to enter manually.
		Example of a command for encrypting a string is shown below.
		encrypt string --password somehardpassword123 --task encryption

		Example of a command for decrypting a string is shown below.
		encrypt string --password somehardpassword123 --task decryption

	2. From parameters directly

		In this mode, the parameters are defined directly to the class object. All the paramters that are acceptable are listed below in the syntax of this class.

		StringEncrypter(
			text = 'Some random string',
			password = 'Some hard password',
		)

		In this mode, the text that is to be encrypted is specified directly and there are no parameters to specify the task of encryption or decryption. The encryption and decryption can be done by calling the encrypt() and decrypt() method directly.
		Example is shown below.

		enc = StringEncrypter(text = 'Some random text to be processed.', password = 'somehardpassword123')

		enc.encrypt()
		enc.decrypt()

	Some points to be noted about this StringEncrypter are listed below :
	* Any text encrypted using this tool can be decrypted using only this class / tool and the encryption password only.
	* After encryption or decryption, the class variable self.text is replaced with the output text.

		In this mode, the user entered arguments at the shell / terminal are passed to this class object at the parameter 'arguments'. The arguments that are parsed are listed below.

		* The file should exists on the local machine as well as proper permission for the current user.

		There is also another flag for documentation mode (printing the help section text for the class object / tool). The flag / argument is --help.

		Example and syntax of the command is shown below.

		encrypt file --password somehardpassword123 --file /location/to/file.txt --task encrypt

class DirectoryEncrypter:
	"""
	This class serves the funcionality of encryption / decryption of user specified directory. The process of encryption is done using the user specified password. The same password which was used for encryption is used for decryption as well. The encryption algorithm used by this class is close to same as other encryption classes defined in this module file.

	The encryption process here is a bit long and more organised. Each files of the user specified directory are encrypted one by one. Also, there are options for ignoring specific files during the encryption / decryption. The structure and information related to the encryption of a directory are stored in a config file in the user specified directory. The file is named '.encryption_config'.

	The structure of the config file is shown below.
	{
		"password" : "...",
		"ignorefiles" : [],
		"created_on" : ...,
		"last_modified" : ...,
	}

	The config file stores the password hash, thus when the user decrypts the directory, the password verification process is done. The user entered password is verified against the original password hash stored in the config file. There are also information stored there like, date of creation, last modfiied, etc.

	The class object when created, some of the information are required to be entered by the user. There are two ways of entering the information by the user. The ways are listed below.

	1. Via argument tokens

		In this mode,
		The argument tokens entered by the user at the shell (command line) are passed to this class object at the 'arguments' parameters. The syntax is shown below.

		DirectoryEncrypter(arguments = [<argument-list>])

		The arguments that are recognized by this class / tool are listed below.
		--password            Used to specify the password for the encryption / decryption
		--directory           Used to specify the directory for the encryption / decryption
		--task                Used to specify whether to encrypt / decrypt
		--ignore              Used to launch the ignore files mode (the user can mention the files to ignore)
		--help                Used to launch the documentation mode (the help section is displayed on the console screen)

		If there are any whitespaces in the inputs, then use the backslash (\). Below are some examples for the usage of this tool.

		# Command for encryption of a directory with password 'somehardpassword123'
		encrypt directory --directory /location/to/directory --password somehardpassword123 --task encrypt

		# Command for decryption of a directory with password 'somehardpassword123'
		encrypt directory --directory /location/to/directory --password somehardpassword123 --task decrypt

		# Command for encryption of a directory + ignoring some specific files
		encrypt directory --directory /location/to/directory --password somehardpassword123 --task encrypt --ignore

		# Command for displaying the help section for the tool
		encrypt directory --help

	2. Directly passing parameters

		In this mode,
		The parameters are passed directly into the class object. The syntax for the usage is listed below.

		DirectoryEncrypter(
			directory = '/location/to/directory',
			password = '<password>',
		)

		There are two parameters to be specified when launching the class object / declaring the class object. The parameters are : directory, password.
		The 'directory' parameter is used to specify the location of the directory which is needed to be encrypted / decrypted.
		The 'password' parameter is used to specify the password for the encryption / decryption.

		Further processes are listed below in the form of examples.

		# Declaring the class object
		enc = DirectoryEncrypter(directory = '/location/to/directory', password = 'somehardpassword123')

		# Specifying the ignorefiles (The files to be ignored while encryption / decryption)
		enc.ignorefiles = ['filename1.txt', 'filename2.docx', 'filename3.jpeg']

		# Encrypting the directory
		enc.encrypt()

		# Checking the password before decryption
		enc.check(password = True)

		# Checking the complete configuration of the encrypted directory before decrypting
		enc.check(all = True)

		# Decrypting the encrypted directory
		enc.decrypt()

	Some of the points to be noted about this class are listed below :
	* The sub-folders in the specified directory are skipped, just the files are encrypted.

	* The complete process of encryption and decryption might have some flaws. There might occur some errors related to key generation, discontinuity, etc, that could lead to serious loss of the data.

	* Security is not ensured by us. If there are situations like the data is completly corrupted during the process, then the authors are not responsible for the loss of the data. The authors are responsible for the bugs, not the mistakes commited by the users / clients. Thus, use this tool / class object safely and with your own risk.

	* For any bugs and errors, kindly create an issue on the github mirror of this repository or contact the author of this module file (Contact address / email addres listed at the top of the document).

	CUSTOM CONFIG

	This class also accepts custom configuration from the user. Using the --use-config flag while launching the command for this, we command this tool to use a custom config file that too is specified by the user. Before encryption / decryption, we then ask the user for entering custom config in two different ways. The ways are listed below.
	1. .encryption_config at the directory

		In this mode, if there exists a file named '.encryption_config' already present in the user specified directory. Then, the tool loads the config file information from that file only. If the user wants to load information from any other way then there must not exists any file in that directory. This file is loaded in the same way the default config file is loaded in this tool (class object).

	2. Custom config file location

		In this mode, the user is asked to enter the file location which directs the tool to a file which contains the contents of the configuration of the encrypted directory. The file that the user will specify should have proper read permissions and the contents should be valid.

	3. Custom config hash

		In this mode, the user is asked to enter the hash code of the config file. Entering the complete string will be used to extract the configuration of the encrypted directory. The hash code looks something like this, as shown below.

		eyJwYXNzd29yZCI6ICJiOGU5NDZlNmY2NWU3M2Q1MDlkMzlkNzBkOTYzZWNlMyIsICJpZ25vcmVmaWxlcyI6IFsidGVzdDEucG5nIiwgInRlc3QzLmJmIiwgInRlc3QyLnR4dCIsICJ0ZXN0NC5weSJdLCAiY3JlYXRlZF9vbiI6IDE2MjQzMzIxNDMuMDcyNTMzLCAibGFzdF9tb2RpZmllZCI6IDAuMH0=

	This custom config feature might be a little different and odd, below are some points that will explain how it makes a difference.
	1. Even if we specify a custom config file, we still have to specify the password for encryption and decryption.
	2. The configuration for an encrypted directory stores other properties like ignorefiles, etc. The ignorefiles property is a list of files that are to be ignored during the encryption and decryption process.

		This method / function serves the functionality of fetching the information of encryption config file for encryption / decryption of a directory. This function loads many information from the class variables like self.directory, etc. Some additional information is attached below. 

		This class also accepts custom configuration from the user. Using the --use-config flag while launching the command for this, we command this tool to use a custom config file that too is specified by the user. Before encryption / decryption, we then ask the user for entering custom config in two different ways. The ways are listed below.
		1. .encryption_config at the directory

			In this mode, if there exists a file named '.encryption_config' already present in the user specified directory. Then, the tool loads the config file information from that file only. If the user wants to load information from any other way then there must not exists any file in that directory. This file is loaded in the same way the default config file is loaded in this tool (class object).

		2. Custom config file location

			In this mode, the user is asked to enter the file location which directs the tool to a file which contains the contents of the configuration of the encrypted directory. The file that the user will specify should have proper read permissions and the contents should be valid.

		3. Custom config hash

			In this mode, the user is asked to enter the hash code of the config file. Entering the complete string will be used to extract the configuration of the encrypted directory. The hash code looks something like this, as shown below.

			eyJwYXNzd29yZCI6ICJiOGU5NDZlNmY2NWU3M2Q1MDlkMzlkNzBkOTYzZWNlMyIsICJpZ25vcmVmaWxlcyI6IFsidGVzdDEucG5nIiwgInRlc3QzLmJmIiwgInRlc3QyLnR4dCIsICJ0ZXN0NC5weSJdLCAiY3JlYXRlZF9vbiI6IDE2MjQzMzIxNDMuMDcyNTMzLCAibGFzdF9tb2RpZmllZCI6IDAuMH0=

		This custom config feature might be a little different and odd, below are some points that will explain how it makes a difference.
		1. Even if we specify a custom config file, we still have to specify the password for encryption and decryption.
		2. The configuration for an encrypted directory stores other properties like ignorefiles, etc. The ignorefiles property is a list of files that are to be ignored during the encryption and decryption process.
